Filings may be submitted by email, fax, or regular U.S. mail. Please review the following step-by-step instructions to help us process your filings as efficiently as possible. Please note that we are not an e-filing court and this is not an automated process. Individual people are receiving your emails and faxes and processing them either on-site or remotely with new procedures created in response to the public health crisis. You will not receive confirmation that we are in receipt of your filings. In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PPII. The Court will not issue public orders with PPII. Protected Personal Identifying Information includes: The state court system has developed specific forms that must be used when submitting PPII to the court. These forms are, MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) and MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information). Due to the amendments of MCR 1.109 and 8.119 relating to PPII, images of court documents filed up through March 31, 2022 are no longer available to view online on our website via Case Access. Any public filed on or after April 1, 2022 is available to view online. See our Copy Request instructions here for more information on how to obtain copies of documents dated prior to April 1, 2022. *For all Filers, Including Attorneys/GALs/Court-Appointed Counsel: Do not include protected personal identifying information on documents that you file with the court except through either MC97 or MC97a. You are responsible for redacting any PPII in documents you submit to the court or take other protective measures. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PPII and to require that the information instead to be listed on a second separate form, either mc97 or mc97a. For more information, please go to SCAOs website here: Protecting Personal Identifying Information (michigan.gov) Please be aware that the filing system at Wayne County Probate Court is a manual electronic process, as this Court is not yet a true e-filing court. After your filing has been processed, you will receive notice to pay any requisite fees. To make payment of fees and to check the status of your filing, see the Courts website under Case Access; follow the instructions. Hearing dates may not be scheduled, and updated Letters may not be received for roughly one to three days after payment has been made. Do not send emails asking for updates on your filing/hearing/requests until after three weeks have passed since the submission of your documents, as responding to the frequent inquiries slows our progress. Thank you for your patience. Please continue to monitor our website for updates and other important information. If your filing also requires a hearing (almost all petitions except for Petitions/Order for Assignment (small estates)): Requesing Updated Letters of Authority. Please be aware that you can now view images from case files via the Case Access link on this site. This change has been implemented to facilitate the review of documents due to the restriction of access to the Court during the public health emergency. The following items will not be accessible: Court rule amendments to MCR 1.109(D) & 8.119(H) effective April 1, 2022 regarding protected personal information (PII) will make it impossible for the Court to allow access to documents containing PII via our website. To obtain copies of court documents, see the Copy Request page of this website. Effective July 2020, the Wayne County Probate Court no longer issues fiduciary letters (letters of authority, guardianships, and conservatorships) and other certified copies of documents with a raised seal. The Court utilizes an electronic seal only to validate the authenticity of the original document. Parties relying on letters should consider the following: Parties utilizing letters should consider the following: For petitions where publication is required andor notice to unknown creditors, please be aware that the Detroit Legal News is open and continuing to publish per their normal schedule.

Filings may be submitted by email, fax, or regular U.S. mail. Please review the following step-by-step instructions to help us process your filings as efficiently as possible. Please note that we are not an e-filing court and this is not an automated process. Individual people are receiving your emails and faxes and processing them either on-site or remotely with new procedures created in response to the public health crisis. You will not receive confirmation that we are in receipt of your filings. In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PPII. The Court will not issue public orders with PPII. Protected Personal Identifying Information includes: The state court system has developed specific forms that must be used when submitting PPII to the court. These forms are, MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) and MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information). Due to the amendments of MCR 1.109 and 8.119 relating to PPII, images of court documents filed up through March 31, 2022 are no longer available to view online on our website via Case Access. Any public filed on or after April 1, 2022 is available to view online. See our Copy Request instructions here for more information on how to obtain copies of documents dated prior to April 1, 2022. *For all Filers, Including Attorneys/GALs/Court-Appointed Counsel: Do not include protected personal identifying information on documents that you file with the court except through either MC97 or MC97a. You are responsible for redacting any PPII in documents you submit to the court or take other protective measures. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PPII and to require that the information instead to be listed on a second separate form, either mc97 or mc97a. For more information, please go to SCAOs website here: Protecting Personal Identifying Information (michigan.gov) Please be aware that the filing system at Wayne County Probate Court is a manual electronic process, as this Court is not yet a true e-filing court. After your filing has been processed, you will receive notice to pay any requisite fees. To make payment of fees and to check the status of your filing, see the Courts website under Case Access; follow the instructions. Hearing dates may not be scheduled, and updated Letters may not be received for roughly one to three days after payment has been made. Do not send emails asking for updates on your filing/hearing/requests until after three weeks have passed since the submission of your documents, as responding to the frequent inquiries slows our progress. Thank you for your patience. Please continue to monitor our website for updates and other important information. If your filing also requires a hearing (almost all petitions except for Petitions/Order for Assignment (small estates)): Requesing Updated Letters of Authority. Please be aware that you can now view images from case files via the Case Access link on this site. This change has been implemented to facilitate the review of documents due to the restriction of access to the Court during the public health emergency. The following items will not be accessible: Court rule amendments to MCR 1.109(D) & 8.119(H) effective April 1, 2022 regarding protected personal information (PII) will make it impossible for the Court to allow access to documents containing PII via our website. To obtain copies of court documents, see the Copy Request page of this website. Effective July 2020, the Wayne County Probate Court no longer issues fiduciary letters (letters of authority, guardianships, and conservatorships) and other certified copies of documents with a raised seal. The Court utilizes an electronic seal only to validate the authenticity of the original document. Parties relying on letters should consider the following: Parties utilizing letters should consider the following: For petitions where publication is required andor notice to unknown creditors, please be aware that the Detroit Legal News is open and continuing to publish per their normal schedule.
