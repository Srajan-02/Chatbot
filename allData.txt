In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PII. The Court cannot accept the old forms after March 31, 2022.
PII must be listed on a new form, either MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) or MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information).
Due to the amendment of MCR 1.109 and 8.119, images of court documents filed prior to March 31, 2022 are no longer available to view online on our website via Case Access. Any document filed on or after April 1, 2022 is available to view online. See our Copy Request instructions here for more information on how to obtain copies of documents dated prior to April 1, 2022.
*For all Filers, Including Attorneys/GALs/Court-Appointed Counsel: Do not include protected personal identifying information on documents that you file with the court unless necessary. Protected PII is: date of birth, financial account numbers, drivers license/state id/passport numbers, and social security numbers. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PII or to require that the information is included on a second separate form (mc97 or mc97a). For more information, please go to SCAOs website here: Protecting Personal Identifying Information (michigan.gov).

In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PII. The Court cannot accept the old forms after March 31, 2022.
PII must be listed on a new form, either MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) or MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information).
Due to the amendment of MCR 1.109 and 8.119, images of court documents filed prior to March 31, 2022 are no longer available to view online on our website via Case Access. Any document filed on or after April 1, 2022 is available to view online. See our Copy Request instructions here for more information on how to obtain copies of documents dated prior to April 1, 2022.
*For all Filers, Including Attorneys/GALs/Court-Appointed Counsel: Do not include protected personal identifying information on documents that you file with the court unless necessary. Protected PII is: date of birth, financial account numbers, drivers license/state id/passport numbers, and social security numbers. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PII or to require that the information is included on a second separate form (mc97 or mc97a). For more information, please go to SCAOs website here: Protecting Personal Identifying Information (michigan.gov).
Please be aware that the filing system at Wayne County Probate Court is a manual electronic process, as this Court is not yet a true e-filing court.

Hearing dates may not be scheduled, and updated Letters may not be received for roughly one to three days after payment has been made.

In limited circumstances, the court may consider your petition an emergency and schedule a hearing within a few days of filing the petition, rather than the standard timeframe of 3-6 weeks.
In most situations, the emergency hearing resolves the matter only temporarily and a full hearing will still need to be held.
For example, a guardian can be appointed on a temporary basis only until the full hearing so that the interested persons can be notified and to allow time for the guardian ad litem to report to the court. .

In limited circumstances, the court may consider your petition an emergency and schedule a hearing within a few days of filing the petition, rather than the standard timeframe of 3-6 weeks.
In most situations, the emergency hearing resolves the matter only temporarily and a full hearing will still need to be held.
For example, a guardian can be appointed on a temporary basis only until the full hearing so that the interested persons can be notified and to allow time for the guardian ad litem to report to the court. .

In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PII. The Court cannot accept the old forms after March 31, 2022.
PII must be listed on a new form, either MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) or MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information).

Protected PII is: date of birth, financial account numbers, drivers license/state id/passport numbers, and social security numbers. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PII or to require that the information is included on a second separate form (mc97 or mc97a).

Please note that we are not an e-filing court and this is not an automated process.

In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PII. The Court cannot accept the old forms after March 31, 2022.
PII must be listed on a new form, either MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) or MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information).
Due to the amendment of MCR 1.109 and 8.119, images of court documents filed prior to March 31, 2022 are no longer available to view online on our website via Case Access. Any document filed on or after April 1, 2022 is available to view online. See our Copy Request instructions here for more information on how to obtain copies of documents dated prior to April 1, 2022.
*For all Filers, Including Attorneys/GALs/Court-Appointed Counsel: Do not include protected personal identifying information on documents that you file with the court unless necessary. Protected PII is: date of birth, financial account numbers, drivers license/state id/passport numbers, and social security numbers. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PII or to require that the information is included on a second separate form (mc97 or mc97a). For more information, please go to SCAOs website here: Protecting Personal Identifying Information (michigan.gov).
Please be aware that the filing system at Wayne County Probate Court is a manual electronic process, as this Court is not yet a true e-filing court. After your filing has been processed, you will receive notice to pay any requisite fees. To make payment of fees and to check the status of your filing, see the Courts website under Case Access; follow the instructions.
Hearing dates may not be scheduled, and updated Letters may not be received for roughly one to three days after payment has been made.
Do not send emails asking for updates on your filing/hearing/requests until after three weeks have passed since the submission of your documents, as responding to the frequent inquiries slows our progress. Thank you for your patience.
Please continue to monitor our website for updates and other important information.

access to documents containing PII via our website. To obtain copies of court

In limited circumstances, the court may consider your petition an emergency and schedule a hearing within a few days of filing the petition, rather than the standard timeframe of 3-6 weeks.
In most situations, the emergency hearing resolves the matter only temporarily and a full hearing will still need to be held.
For example, a guardian can be appointed on a temporary basis only until the full hearing so that the interested persons can be notified and to allow time for the guardian ad litem to report to the court. .

In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PII. The Court cannot accept the old forms after March 31, 2022.
PII must be listed on a new form, either MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) or MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information).
Due to the amendment of MCR 1.109 and 8.119, images of court documents filed prior to March 31, 2022 are no longer available to view online on our website via Case Access. Any document filed on or after April 1, 2022 is available to view online. See our Copy Request instructions here for more information on how to obtain copies of documents dated prior to April 1, 2022.
*For all Filers, Including Attorneys/GALs/Court-Appointed Counsel: Do not include protected personal identifying information on documents that you file with the court unless necessary. Protected PII is: date of birth, financial account numbers, drivers license/state id/passport numbers, and social security numbers. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PII or to require that the information is included on a second separate form (mc97 or mc97a). For more information, please go to SCAOs website here: Protecting Personal Identifying Information (michigan.gov).

In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PII. The Court cannot accept the old forms after March 31, 2022.
PII must be listed on a new form, either MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) or MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information).
Due to the amendment of MCR 1.109 and 8.119, images of court documents filed prior to March 31, 2022 are no longer available to view online on our website via Case Access. Any document filed on or after April 1, 2022 is available to view online. See our Copy Request instructions here for more information on how to obtain copies of documents dated prior to April 1, 2022.
*For all Filers, Including Attorneys/GALs/Court-Appointed Counsel: Do not include protected personal identifying information on documents that you file with the court unless necessary. Protected PII is: date of birth, financial account numbers, drivers license/state id/passport numbers, and social security numbers. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PII or to require that the information is included on a second separate form (mc97 or mc97a). For more information, please go to SCAOs website here: Protecting Personal Identifying Information (michigan.gov).
Please be aware that the filing system at Wayne County Probate Court is a manual electronic process, as this Court is not yet a true e-filing court. After your filing has been processed, you will receive notice to pay any requisite fees. To make payment of fees and to check the status of your filing, see the Courts website under Case Access; follow the instructions.
Hearing dates may not be scheduled, and updated Letters may not be received for roughly one to three days after payment has been made.
Do not send emails asking for updates on your filing/hearing/requests until after three weeks have passed since the submission of your documents, as responding to the frequent inquiries slows our progress. Thank you for your patience.
Please continue to monitor our website for updates and other important information.

In limited circumstances, the court may consider your petition an emergency and schedule a hearing within a few days of filing the petition, rather than the standard timeframe of 3-6 weeks.
In most situations, the emergency hearing resolves the matter only temporarily and a full hearing will still need to be held.
For example, a guardian can be appointed on a temporary basis only until the full hearing so that the interested persons can be notified and to allow time for the guardian ad litem to report to the court. .

In limited circumstances, the court may consider your petition an emergency and schedule a hearing within a few days of filing the petition, rather than the standard timeframe of 3-6 weeks.
In most situations, the emergency hearing resolves the matter only temporarily and a full hearing will still need to be held.
For example, a guardian can be appointed on a temporary basis only until the full hearing so that the interested persons can be notified and to allow time for the guardian ad litem to report to the court. .
Important Note: Please do not send a copy of any Social Security card to the Court.
We do not require it and cannot keep it in our records.

Please note that we are not an e-filing court and this is not an automated process.

In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PII. The Court cannot accept the old forms after March 31, 2022.
PII must be listed on a new form, either MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) or MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information).
Due to the amendment of MCR 1.109 and 8.119, images of court documents filed prior to March 31, 2022 are no longer available to view online on our website via Case Access. Any document filed on or after April 1, 2022 is available to view online. See our Copy Request instructions here for more information on how to obtain copies of documents dated prior to April 1, 2022.
*For all Filers, Including Attorneys/GALs/Court-Appointed Counsel: Do not include protected personal identifying information on documents that you file with the court unless necessary. Protected PII is: date of birth, financial account numbers, drivers license/state id/passport numbers, and social security numbers. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PII or to require that the information is included on a second separate form (mc97 or mc97a). For more information, please go to SCAOs website here: Protecting Personal Identifying Information (michigan.gov).
Please be aware that the filing system at Wayne County Probate Court is a manual electronic process, as this Court is not yet a true e-filing court. After your filing has been processed, you will receive notice to pay any requisite fees. To make payment of fees and to check the status of your filing, see the Courts website under Case Access; follow the instructions.
Hearing dates may not be scheduled, and updated Letters may not be received for roughly one to three days after payment has been made.

Do not send emails asking for updates on your filing/hearing/requests until after three weeks have passed since the submission of your documents, as responding to the frequent inquiries slows our progress. Thank you for your patience.

Court rule amendments to MCR 1.109(D) & 8.119(H) effective April 1, 2022 regarding
protected personal information (PII) will make it impossible for the Court to allow
access to documents containing PII via our website. To obtain copies of court
documents, see the Copy Request page of this website.

In limited circumstances, the court may consider your petition an emergency and schedule a hearing within a few days of filing the petition, rather than the standard timeframe of 3-6 weeks.
In most situations, the emergency hearing resolves the matter only temporarily and a full hearing will still need to be held.
For example, a guardian can be appointed on a temporary basis only until the full hearing so that the interested persons can be notified and to allow time for the guardian ad litem to report to the court. .

In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PII. The Court cannot accept the old forms after March 31, 2022.
PII must be listed on a new form, either MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) or MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information).
Due to the amendment of MCR 1.109 and 8.119, images of court documents filed prior to March 31, 2022 are no longer available to view online on our website via Case Access. Any document filed on or after April 1, 2022 is available to view online. See our Copy Request instructions here for more information on how to obtain copies of documents dated prior to April 1, 2022.
*For all Filers, Including Attorneys/GALs/Court-Appointed Counsel: Do not include protected personal identifying information on documents that you file with the court unless necessary. Protected PII is: date of birth, financial account numbers, drivers license/state id/passport numbers, and social security numbers. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PII or to require that the information is included on a second separate form (mc97 or mc97a). For more information, please go to SCAOs website here: Protecting Personal Identifying Information (michigan.gov).

resolving issues related to this process.
Filings may be submitted by email, fax, or regular U.S. mail. Please review the following
step-by-step instructions to help us process your filings as efficiently as possible.
Please note that we are not an e-filing court and this is not an automated process.

will not receive confirmation that we are in receipt of your filings.

In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PII. The Court cannot accept the old forms after March 31, 2022.
PII must be listed on a new form, either MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) or MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information).
Due to the amendment of MCR 1.109 and 8.119, images of court documents filed prior to March 31, 2022 are no longer available to view online on our website via Case Access. Any document filed on or after April 1, 2022 is available to view online. See our Copy Request instructions here for more information on how to obtain copies of documents dated prior to April 1, 2022.
*For all Filers, Including Attorneys/GALs/Court-Appointed Counsel: Do not include protected personal identifying information on documents that you file with the court unless necessary. Protected PII is: date of birth, financial account numbers, drivers license/state id/passport numbers, and social security numbers. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PII or to require that the information is included on a second separate form (mc97 or mc97a). For more information, please go to SCAOs website here: Protecting Personal Identifying Information (michigan.gov).
Please be aware that the filing system at Wayne County Probate Court is a manual electronic process, as this Court is not yet a true e-filing court. After your filing has been processed, you will receive notice to pay any requisite fees. To make payment of fees and to check the status of your filing, see the Courts website under Case Access; follow the instructions.
Hearing dates may not be scheduled, and updated Letters may not be received for roughly one to three days after payment has been made.

Please be aware that you can now view images from case files via the Cass Access link on this site. This change has been implemented to facilitate the review of documents due to the restriction of access to the Court during the public health emergency. The following items will not be accessible:.
Court rule amendments to MCR 1.109(D) & 8.119(H) effective April 1, 2022 regarding
protected personal information (PII) will make it impossible for the Court to allow
access to documents containing PII via our website. To obtain copies of court

In limited circumstances, the court may consider your petition an emergency and schedule a hearing within a few days of filing the petition, rather than the standard timeframe of 3-6 weeks.
In most situations, the emergency hearing resolves the matter only temporarily and a full hearing will still need to be held.
For example, a guardian can be appointed on a temporary basis only until the full hearing so that the interested persons can be notified and to allow time for the guardian ad litem to report to the court. .

In limited circumstances, the court may consider your petition an emergency and schedule a hearing within a few days of filing the petition, rather than the standard timeframe of 3-6 weeks.
In most situations, the emergency hearing resolves the matter only temporarily and a full hearing will still need to be held.
For example, a guardian can be appointed on a temporary basis only until the full hearing so that the interested persons can be notified and to allow time for the guardian ad litem to report to the court. .
Important Note: Please do not send a copy of any Social Security card to the Court.

Frequently Asked Questions.
What is Involuntary Commitment?.
This is the process used in a probate court to help a person who may be mentally ill and harmful to self or others and refuses to seek treatment or whose judgment is so impaired they do not understand their need for treatment.
.
How do I know if a person is mentally ill?.
Watch the person's behavior carefully. If the behavior only occurs when the person has been taking drugs or using alcohol, the problem could be substance abuse, not mental illness.
However, if the behavior is continuous, and if the person threatens or actually harms themselves or others, or their judgment is so impaired that they do not understand their need for treatment, you may file a petition with the Probate Court where the person resides or is found.
The Probate Court judge can order the person to be evaluated and, based on medical evaluations and testimony, can order the person to be treated for mental illness.
If you need more information about getting help for someone who may need mental health treatment, call the Detroit-Wayne Integrated Health Network (DWIHN)at (313) 833-2500 or visit their website at www.dwihn.org
.
Who should I call?.
If you need more information about getting help for someone who may need mental health treatment, call the Detroit-Wayne Integrated Health Network (DWIHN)at (313) 833-2500 or visit their website at www.dwihn.org
.
What if the person needs an immediate evaluation?.
You can complete a Petition for Mental Health Treatment, pcm201 (include the mc505 and mc97 form). There is no fee. You will need to complete the form accurately, including your observations of the persons behavior, and request that a peace officer take the individual into protective custody and transport the individual to the hospital.
Petitions can be filed by email anytime and will be processed during normal business hours. See this page for filing instructions.
.
What happens next?.
After your Petition is accepted and processed, you will then have a hearing via Zoom in front of a Probate Judge.
You will need to appear at the hearing or your petition will be dismissed. Please see this page for more Zoom hearing information.
If the Judge signs the Order for Examination/Transport to authorize a psychiatric evaluation, you will receive via email all of the completed paperwork.
You will then call 911 (Detroit only) or visit your local police precinct to arrange for the person to be transported to a crisis center.
The Order is only valid for 10 days.
If the police cannot find the person to transport them within 10 days, the order expires and a new petition would need to be filed.
.
What will the Court need to know?.
During the hearing, the judge will verify that you personally observed the behavior and that it happened recently. You will be asked to describe the behavior in detail.
The court will also want to know the individual's substance use habits. If the problem is determined to be substance use related, you will be referred to an agency in your area.
You will also be asked whether every effort has been made to get the person to voluntarily seek help.
.
Where will the person be taken?.
The police will take the person to any emergency department or crisis center.
.
What happens at the crisis center hospital?.
The hospital will perform a psychiatric evaluation within 24 hours and will decide whether the person needs treatment.
.
What if the hospital determines that the person does not require hospitalization?.
If the person does not require hospitalization, or is diagnosed as having a substance use problem, the hospital will release the person. Sometimes the hospital will recommend outpatient treatment.
.
And if the person is diagnosed as requiring treatment?.
Then the person will be sent to a designated hospital for necessary care.
.
Who makes the decision to hospitalize the person for psychiatric treatment?.
The hospital director and the Court are authorized to recommend hospitalization or release.
If the hospital decides that the person requires treatment and the person does not agree to treatment, a representative will file a petition for involuntary treatment and another hearing will be scheduled.
An attorney will be appointed to represent the person and the attorney is required to meet with them.
Sometimes the person agrees to receive treatment at that point.
If the hearing is held, the court will hear testimony from the clinical staff at the hospital and may enter an order for the person to receive treatment.
.
How long will the person be kept in the treatment facility?.
The Court may order up to 60 days of treatment on the initial admission order, but the hospital makes the final decision and could release the person earlier.
.
Could it be longer?.
Yes. The hospital may petition the Court for continued treatment. The Court will then hold a hearing to decide whether to grant the petition or discharge the patient.
.
What is Assisted Outpatient Treatment?.
It is often not necessary for the person to remain hospitalized to receive treatment; instead, treatment can be provided on an outpatient basis.
The court may order up to 180 days of assisted outpatient treatment on an initial order for involuntary treatment. .

When would a petition for a trust be filed?.
There are several circumstances under which a petition to establish a trust would be filed.
The most common are:
.
I. A party may petition the Court for permission to establish a trust under certain circumstances.
These include: A conservator wishes to establish a trust for a protected individual or a developmentally disabled individual (due to an out-of-court settlement, to preserve eligibility for Medicaid or other government benefits, etc.).
If a Judge approves the creation of a trust and supervision is ordered in an existing Conservatorship case or Developmental Disability case, a separate trust file must be created by filing a Petition for Supervision of Trust and to Qualify Trustee, which will include the trust document.
.
II. No conservatorship exists, but an individual wishes to establish a trust - typically for a minor
due to an out-of-court settlement, to preserve eligibility for Medicaid or other government benefits, etc.
If a Judge grants the Protective Order, a separate trust file must be created by filing a Petition for Supervision of Trust and to Qualify Trustee which will include the trust document.
III.	A Circuit Court settlement provides for the establishment of a trust for a minor or legally incapacitated individual.
No conservatorship is established.
Per court rule, the trust must be approved by the Probate Court.
IV.	Typically, there is no preexisting active trust file when a petition of this type is filed.
A party may petition the Probate Court for supervision of a trust, for the court to order specific action, or to obtain the courts approval for a particular action, for example:.
•	Supervision requested because trust beneficiary believes trustee is not acting correctly.
•	Request for termination of trust, removal of trustee, release of trust document, distribution of money, to compel an accounting, objection to attorney and/or trustee fees, etc.
•	Trustee seeks formal approval of exercise of power under trust (i.e., make distribution, tax election, change of investments, etc.).
•	Trustee (or other interested person) seeks approval to alter, reform, or terminate trust.

This process is used if no conservatorship or developmental disability case exists.
In these situations, a protective order must be filed to obtain authorization to establish the trust. .
1.	Form Used: PC 639, Petition for Appointment of Conservator and/or Protective Order; attorney drafted form can also be accepted, either filed with the PC 639 or on its own. .

FAQs.
When an individual with a developmental disability needs protection for any reason, including protection from neglect, exploitation, or abuse, the person may be in need of a guardian. An individual with a developmental disability may need a guardian of the person to make daily living decisions. An individual with a developmental disability may need a guardian of the estate to manage his or her property or finances.
The law states that a guardian may be appointed if a court determines that a person is an individual with a developmental disability. The law defines a developmental disability as:.
A severe, chronic condition attributable to mental and/or physical impairment likely to continue indefinitely that results in substantial functional limitations in at least three of the following areas:
self-care, language, learning, mobility, self-direction, capacity for independent living, and economic self-sufficiency..
Generally, it can be said that the guardian of the person makes decisions about the person, such as medical or housing decisions, and the guardian of the estate makes decisions about the property or the finances of an individual with a developmental disability. A guardian of the person and a guardian of the estate can be the same person or institution, or they may be different. For example, a guardian of the person could be a person and a guardian of the estate could be a trust company or bank. .
Unless an emergency exists and the appointment of a temporary guardian is requested, evaluations of the individual with a developmental disability must be conducted. .
Whoever files the petition for the appointment of a guardian for an individual with a developmental disability, they must attach evaluations of the proposed wards mental, physical, social, educational condition, adaptive behavior, and social skills. These evaluations can be obtained by contacting your own private sources or by contacting the Detroit-Wayne Integrated Health Network (DWIHN). If a facility or program director is the petitioner, then a recommendation from the Informed Consent Board is required.
Click here for more information on how to open a case.
A guardian of the person and estate may be appointed by a Probate Judge after a petition is filed in the Probate Court. The petition may be filed by anyone interested in the well-being of an individual with a developmental disability.
When the petition is filed, professionally licensed persons must evaluate the individual with a developmental disability and report their findings to the court. Upon receipt of the evaluations, a hearing will be scheduled and held within 30 days. The person who files the petition has the responsibility to properly notify the persons who have a right to know about the hearing.
On the date of the hearing, the petitioner and anyone else who wants to take part in the hearing goes before the Judge and explains the need for a guardian of the person or guardian of the estate. The court will appoint an attorney to represent the individual with a developmental disability at the hearing. Sometimes, the court will also appoint a guardian ad litem to assist the attorney. In addition, detailed testimony must be taken from one report evaluator. The Judge will decide whether to appoint a guardian of the person and/or a guardian of the estate.
The person who is appointed guardian of the person is required to file an Acceptance of Appointment. The person who is appointed guardian of the estate may also be required to file a Bond to protect the assets of the individual with a developmental disability. After filing the Acceptance of Appointment (and Bond, if required), Letters of Guardianship will be issued to the guardian of the person or the guardian of the estate. The Letters of Guardianship give the guardian of the person or guardian of the estate the right to perform certain duties, unless the court restricts the authority.
The Account must list
receipts (monies in) and disbursements (monies out). Save your receipts; one
must be presented to the court for each disbursement. .
Click here for more detailed information about how to terminate the guardianship. .
Anyone, including the individual with a developmental disability, may file a petition to modify or terminate the guardianship or to have a different guardian appointed. When the individual no longer has a developmental disability or dies, the guardian must notify the court immediately so that the guardianship can be ended and the court's case closed. Before the guardian of the estate can be discharged, a final account will have to be filed and approved by the court and the court will have to be satisfied that the individual or his or her estate has received whatever assets remain.

The Michigan Supreme Court requires the use of MC 95,*Request
for Approval of Bond and Notice Settlement/Judgment/Wrongful Death Settlement
(MC95) where either (1) in a wrongful death claim where a minor or legally
incapacitated individual are to receive distributions in excess of $5,000 or (2)
in all settlements and judgments when the plaintiff is a minor or legally
incapacitated individual and the value of the settlement or judgment to the
minor or legally incapacitated individual is more than $5,000. A procedure
has also been established for settlements or judgments which provide for the
creation of a trust for a minor and legally incapacitated individual.
.
Important Note #1: For a settlement for a minor, a
conservator must be appointed if the minor is to receive either (1) more than
$5,000 payable immediately or (2) in installments of over $5,000 in any single
year during minority. The judgment or dismissal must provide that payment
be made to the conservator on behalf of the minor.
Important Note #2: If a conservator has been appointed,
any
proposed settlement or judgment must be reviewed by the probate court, even if
the amount to be paid is less than $5,000. If the settlement is less than
$5,000, and a conservator has been appointed, all of the proceeds must be paid
to the conservator.
.

of a trust as part of a settlement or judgment, seeProbate Settlements &

.
Michigan law prohibits court employees from providing legal advice and completing forms, petitions, or documents. MCL 700.1211. Click here for a list of legal aidlegal services which may be able to provide you with assistance.
What is a probate bond?
A probate bond is an insurance policy that protects assets and income in an estate, trust, or conservatorship from certain actions of the fiduciary (either the personal presentative, trustee, or conservator, respectively).
This bond is obtained through a surety company, and often referred to as a fiduciary bond.
Probate bonds, once obtained, can only be discharged and canceled through an order from the Probate Court.
When would a bond be obtained?
Every fiduciary (whether guardian, conservator, personal representative, etc.) in Probate Court must file an Acceptance of Appointment (AOA), PC571, to qualify with the Court before they can start acting in that role.
The Court may also order that a fiduciary obtain and file a bond in addition to the AOA.
When a person is directed to file an AOA and a bond, both must be submitted for the individual to qualify as the fiduciary and receive the Letter of Authority.
Additionally, sometimes a bond can be ordered after an individual qualifies as a fiduciary.
In these situations, if additional liquid assets (i.e., cash or other assets that can be easily converted into cash) are identified in an estate, trust, or protective proceeding, the court may order the fiduciary file a bond relating to these additional assets.
Further, sometimes a bond that was previously obtained and filed with the court can be modified.
When the assets or income in the estate, trust, or conservatorship change, the Court may review the amount of the bond and increase or decrease the amount to be protected through the bond accordingly.
When a different bond amount is ordered, a new bond order is issued and a new bond or revised bond must be obtained and filed with the Court.
SCAO form PC570, Bond of Fiduciary, (pc570.p65 (michigan.gov)), must be attached to all bonds submitted to the Court.

In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PII. The Court cannot accept the old forms after March 31, 2022.
PII must be listed on a new form, either MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) or MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information).

conservator may also be appointed if the person is unable to manage his or her
property or finances effectively.
.
A petitioner
would file a guardianship petition in either the county where the adult resides
(i.e., where they live) or is present.
.
A petitioner
would file a conservatorship petition in the county where the adult resides
(i.e., where they live).
If the adult
resides outside of
Michigan
,
but has property in
Michigan
,
the petitioner may file a conservatorship in the county where the adults
property is located.
.
Generally it can
be said that the guardian makes decisions about the person, such as medical or
housing decisions, and the conservator makes decisions about the property or
the finances of the person.
A guardian and a conservator can be the same
person or institution or they may be different.
For example, a guardian
could be a person and a conservator could be a trust company or bank.
.
>A guardian or
conservator may be appointed by a Probate Judge after a petition is filed in
the Probate Court.
The petition may be filed by anyone interested in the
well being of the adult.
.
When the
petition is filed, a hearing will be scheduled.
In addition, the court
may appoint a guardian ad litem to investigate the situation and make a
recommendation to the court prior to the hearing.
On the date of
the hearing, the petitioner and anyone else who wants to take part in the
hearing goes before the Judge (all hearings are being done remotely via ZOOM
due
to the health emergency) and explains the need for a guardian or
conservator.
The Judge will decide whether to appoint a guardian and/or a
conservator.
.
The person who
is appointed guardian is required to file an Acceptance of Appointment.
The person who is appointed conservator must also file an Acceptance of
Appointment and may also be required to file a Bond to protect the adults
assets.
After filing the Acceptance of Appointment (and Bond, if required),
Letters of Authority will be issued to the guardian or conservator.
The
Letters of Authority give the guardian or conservator the right to perform
certain duties, unless the court restricts their authority.
.
If an emergency exists, the Judge may appoint a temporary guardian at a hearing. A
letter from a doctor or social worker may be required to explain the nature of the
emergency. Please note that a second hearing is required.
.
.
The guardian generally has the same authority and
responsibility for the adult as a parent has for a minor child.
.
The guardian is required to file every year an
Annual Report of Guardian on Condition of Incapacitated
Individual.
The report must be filed within 56 days of the anniversary date of the
appointment.
They must also give a copy of the report to the adult
and the persons listed on the guardianship petition.
The
information
contained in the report allows the court to assess how the guardianship
is
working and whether it is still necessary.
The court will also review a
guardianship within a year of the guardian being appointed and at least
once
every three years afterwards.
.
You must visit the ward within 3 months of
becoming guardian and at least once every 3 months after your last
visit.
.
The guardian may make routine medical decisions
but may not consent to extraordinary medical procedures without a court
order.
.
A major goal of the guardian is always to try to
restore the ward to independence.
.
.
Within 56 days of being appointed, the
conservator must file an Inventory.
The Inventory is a listing of
all assets of the adult.
Assets may consist of real estate,
stocks,
bonds, certificates of deposit, savings and checking accounts, and
personal belongings and everything in which the adult has an interest.
.
It is the duty of the conservator to care for and
preserve all of the assets of the adult and to represent the adult in
any
legal proceeding.
.
The conservator must keep careful records of all
income of the adult and all disbursements of the adults funds.
The
conservator must keep the adults assets separate from his or her own
assets
and never borrow from the adults assets.
.
It is the duty of the conservator to file an
Annual Account each year within 56 days after the anniversary date of
the
conservators appointment.
They must also give a copy of the
account
to the adult and the persons listed on the conservatorship petition.
.
The account must list receipts (monies
in) and disbursements (monies out).
Save your receipts; one must
be
presented to the court for each disbursement .
.
Anyone,
including the adult, may file a petition to terminate the guardianship or
conservatorship or to have a different guardian or conservator appointed.
With the courts permission, the guardian may resign at any time.
When
the adult is no longer an incapacitated individual or dies, the court should be
notified immediately so that the guardianship or conservatorship can be ended
and the courts case closed.
Before the conservator can be discharged, a
Final Account will have to be filed and approved by the court and the court
will have to be satisfied that the adult or his or her estate has received
whatever assets remain.
.
If you have any
questions about what services or procedures may be available that might make
guardianship or conservatorship unnecessary, you may call the Commission on
Aging, Department of
Mental
Health,

Guardianship.......................$175.00
Conservatorship.....................$175.00
.
When a minor does not
have a responsible parent or adult to make daily living decisions for him or
her, then that minor may be in need of a guardian. When a minor owns
property or needs representation in a legal action, then that minor may need a
conservator.
.
A petitioner would file a guardianship petition in either the county where the minor
resides (i.e., where they live) or is present.
.
A petitioner would file a conservatorship petition in the county where the minor resides
(i.e., where they live). If the minor resides outside of Michigan , but has property in
Michigan , the petitioner may file a conservatorship in the county where the minors
property is located.
.
Generally, it can be said that the guardian makes decisions about the person, such as
medical or housing decisions, and the conservator makes decisions about the property or
the finances of the minor. A guardian and a conservator can be the same person or
institution or they may be different. For example, a guardian could be a person and a
conservator could be a trust company or bank.
.
A guardian or conservator may be appointed by a Probate Judge after a petition is filed
in the Probate Court. The petition may be filed by anyone interested in the well-being
of the minor, except that one type of guardianship (limited) may only be requested by a
parent having custody or by both parents if both parents have custody. For a limited
guardianship, the court must approve a placement plan for the minor, including how long
the guardianship is to last.
.
When the petition is
filed, a hearing will be scheduled as soon as possible (in some emergency
cases, it may be possible to obtain an immediate temporary guardian before the
hearing). The person who files the petition has the responsibility to
properly notify the persons who have a right to know about the hearing. IN
GUARDIANSHIP CASES, IF A PARTY IS INCARCERATED
UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, THEIR NAME,
ADDRESS, AND PRISONER NUMBER MUST BE LISTED ON THE PETITION. TO OBTAIN
THIS INFORMATION, CALL (517) 373-6391 OR GO ON-LINE AT: http://mdocweb.state.mi.us/OTIS2/otis2.html.
In addition,
the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to investigate the situation and make a

On the date of the

file an Acceptance of Appointment and may also be required to file a Bond to
protect the minors assets. After filing the Acceptance of Appointment (and
Bond, if required), Letters of Authority will be issued to the guardian or
conservator. (The Letters of Authority give the guardian or conservator the right to
perform the following duties, unless the court restricts their authority.)
.
Anyone, including the minor who is at least 14 years of age, may file a petition to
modify the guardianship or or to have a different guardian or conservator appointed.
With the courts permission, the guardian may resign at any time. When the minor reaches
18 years of age or dies, the court should be notified so that the guardianship or can be
ended and the courts case closed. Before the conservator can be discharged, a Final
Account will have to be filed and approved by the court and the court will have to be

Link: https://www.wcpc.us/FAQ/powerofattorney.htm , Text: Power of Attorney questions


A Power of Attorney is a written and notarized
document giving a person the legal power to act on behalf of another person
according to the terms of the Power of Attorney. The Probate Court does not become
involved
with these types of documents.
.
The main difference between a Power of Attorney and
a guardianship or conservatorship is court involvement. Guardianships and
conservatorships
are fiduciary relationships created by the court. The court authorizes a person
to act as guardian or conservator of another person according to the terms of
the court order.
.
It depends upon the authority granted by the Power
of Attorney. A power of attorney may grant the individual broad powers
over the person and his/her estate, or limited powers to act only in certain
circumstances.
If the Power of Attorney grants only limited powers, a
guardian or conservator may be necessary or desirable.
.
No. Powers of
Attorney are not filed with the Probate Court.
.
Yes. If a
guardianship or conservatorship was established, and the guardian or
conservator wanted to terminate the Power of Attorney and a dispute arose over
the management of the assets by the person acting under the Power of Attorney, the
Probate Court could hear this matter. The Probate Court can also hear an action to
require, hear, or settle an
accounting of an agent acting under the Power of Attorney.

(1) the estate assets will be less than the cost of the funeral and other
funeral related expenses or (2) the estate assets exceed funeral costs but
there is also an urgent need to obtain medical records, a special personal
representative could be appointed for the sole purpose of obtaining the
deceased persons medical records. The letters
of authority issued by the Court would limit the special personal
representatives powers to securing medical records only.

Filings may be submitted by email, fax, or regular U.S. mail. Please review the following
step-by-step instructions to help us process your filings as efficiently as possible.
Please note that we are not an e-filing court and this is not an automated process.
Individual people are receiving your emails and faxes and processing them either on-site
or remotely with new procedures created in response to the public health crisis. You
will not receive confirmation that we are in receipt of your filings.
.
In order to prevent identity theft, the Michigan Supreme Court requires that as of April 1, 2022 new forms must be used which do not contain PII. The Court cannot accept the old forms after March 31, 2022.
PII must be listed on a new form, either MC 97 (Protected Personal Identifying Information) or MC 97a (Addendum to Protected Personal Identifying Information).
Due to the amendment of MCR 1.109 and 8.119, images of court documents filed prior to March 31, 2022 are no longer available to view online on our website via Case Access. Any document filed on or after April 1, 2022 is available to view online. See our Copy Request instructions here for more information on how to obtain copies of documents dated prior to April 1, 2022.
*For all Filers, Including Attorneys/GALs/Court-Appointed Counsel: Do not include protected personal identifying information on documents that you file with the court unless necessary. Protected PII is: date of birth, financial account numbers, drivers license/state id/passport numbers, and social security numbers. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PII or to require that the information is included on a second separate form (mc97 or mc97a). For more information, please go to SCAOs website here: Protecting Personal Identifying Information (michigan.gov).
Please be aware that the filing system at Wayne County Probate Court is a manual electronic process, as this Court is not yet a true e-filing court. After your filing has been processed, you will receive notice to pay any requisite fees. To make payment of fees and to check the status of your filing, see the Courts website under Case Access; follow the instructions.
Hearing dates may not be scheduled, and updated Letters may not be received for roughly one to three days after payment has been made.
.
Do not send emails asking for updates on your filing/hearing/requests until after three weeks have passed since the submission of your documents, as responding to the frequent inquiries slows our progress. Thank you for your patience.

Court rule amendments to MCR 1.109(D) & 8.119(H) effective April 1, 2022 regarding
protected personal information (PII) will make it impossible for the Court to allow
access to documents containing PII via our website. To obtain copies of court
documents, see the Copy Request page of this website.

In limited circumstances, the court may consider your petition an emergency and schedule a hearing within a few days of filing the petition, rather than the standard timeframe of 3-6 weeks.
In most situations, the emergency hearing resolves the matter only temporarily and a full hearing will still need to be held.
For example, a guardian can be appointed on a temporary basis only until the full hearing so that the interested persons can be notified and to allow time for the guardian ad litem to report to the court. .

Formal
Proceedings (Petition)
.
Formal proceedings are commenced by filing a Petition for Probate and/or Appointment of Personal Representative (Testate/Intestate) (PC 559) and other related papers. After proper notice to all interested persons and the court hearing the probate court may admit a will, determine the heirs of the deceased, and appoint a personal representative. Once the personal representative is appointed, they qualify to act by filing an Acceptance of Appointment (PC 571) and any required bond.
The personal representative will proceed with unsupervised administration until the estate is ready to be closed.
Supervised administration may be requested by checking the appropriate box on the Petition for Probate and/or Appointment of Personal Representative (Testate/Intestate) (PC 559). [Note: the Petition and other papers are the same as those used when filing an unsupervised estate using formal proceedings.]
Supervised administration may also be requested at any time during unsupervised administration.
If supervised administration is granted, the personal representative (unless otherwise ordered by the court), will proceed with the same powers as a personal representative who is not supervised except that in supervised administration a personal representative may not make any distributions to heirs or devisees without a prior court order. .
* Rev 12/23
