Due to the amendments of MCR 1.109 and 8.119 relating to PPII, images of court documents filed up through March 31, 2022 are no longer available to view online on our website via Case Access. Any public filed on or after April 1, 2022 is available to view online. See our Copy Request instructions here for more information on how to obtain copies of documents dated prior to April 1, 2022. *For all Filers, Including Attorneys/GALs/Court-Appointed Counsel: Do not include protected personal identifying information on documents that you file with the court except through either MC97 or MC97a. You are responsible for redacting any PPII in documents you submit to the court or take other protective measures. SCAO forms have been updated to remove fields for PPII and to require that the information instead to be listed on a second separate form, either mc97 or mc97a. For more information, please go to SCAOs website here: Protecting Personal Identifying Information (michigan.gov) Please be aware that the filing system at Wayne County Probate Court is a manual electronic process, as this Court is not yet a true e-filing court. After your filing has been processed, you will receive notice to pay any requisite fees. To make payment of fees and to check the status of your filing, see the Courts website under Case Access; follow the instructions. Hearing dates may not be scheduled, and updated Letters may not be received for roughly one to three days after payment has been made. Do not send emails asking for updates on your filing/hearing/requests until after three weeks have passed since the submission of your documents, as responding to the frequent inquiries slows our progress. Thank you for your patience. Please continue to monitor our website for updates and other important information. If your filing also requires a hearing (almost all petitions except for Petitions/Order for Assignment (small estates)): Requesing Updated Letters of Authority. Please be aware that you can now view images from case files via the Case Access link on this site. This change has been implemented to facilitate the review of documents due to the restriction of access to the Court during the public health emergency. The following items will not be accessible: Court rule amendments to MCR 1.109(D) & 8.119(H) effective April 1, 2022 regarding protected personal information (PII) will make it impossible for the Court to allow access to documents containing PII via our website. To obtain copies of court documents, see the Copy Request page of this website. Effective July 2020, the Wayne County Probate Court no longer issues fiduciary letters (letters of authority, guardianships, and conservatorships) and other certified copies of documents with a raised seal. The Court utilizes an electronic seal only to validate the authenticity of the original document. Parties relying on letters should consider the following: Parties utilizing letters should consider the following: For petitions where publication is required andor notice to unknown creditors, please be aware that the Detroit Legal News is open and continuing to publish per their normal schedule.

Upcoming Court Closures Affecting Filing Hours: February 1, 2024 (Records/Training Day - Emergencies Only) See: WCPC - Working Hours NOTICE: Pursuant to the recent amendment to MCR 5.302, as of January 1, 2024 when commencing a decedent estate and filing the death certificate or alternative documentation of the decedent's death, two copies must be submitted -- one unredacted, and the second redacted of all protected personal identifying information as required by MCR 1.109(D)(9) (PPII). Additionally, if a will that contains PPII is being filed when commencing a decedent estate, the filer must submit a copy of the will with all PPII redacted and the unredacted version. Notice: WCPC has changed its policy relating to subsequent cases opened regarding the same individual or estate. The court will no longer use the same case number by adding a B or respective subsequent letter of the alphabet for cases later opened for the same individual/estate. Beginning July 17, 2023, each new subsequent case will receive its own distinct case number and no new B case numbers will be issued. Wayne County Probate Court is a Remotely Accessible Court Hearings are conducted remotely via ZOOM. Please click here for information about attending hearings.

Formal Proceedings (Petition) Formal proceedings are commenced by filing a Petition for Probate and/or Appointment of Personal Representative (Testate/Intestate) (PC 559) and other related papers. After proper notice to all interested persons and the court hearing the probate court may admit a will, determine the heirs of the deceased, and appoint a personal representative. Once the personal representative is appointed, they qualify to act by filing an Acceptance of Appointment (PC 571) and any required bond. The personal representative will proceed with unsupervised administration until the estate is ready to be closed Supervised administration may be requested by checking the appropriate box on the Petition for Probate and/or Appointment of Personal Representative (Testate/Intestate) (PC 559). [Note: the Petition and other papers are the same as those used when filing an unsupervised estate using formal proceedings.] Supervised administration may also be requested at any time during unsupervised administration. If supervised administration is granted, the personal representative (unless otherwise ordered by the court), will proceed with the same powers as a personal representative who is not supervised except that in supervised administration a personal representative may not make any distributions to heirs or devisees without a prior court order. * Rev 12/23"

    "scripted_value": "Frequently Asked Questions What is Involuntary Commitment? This is the process used in a probate court to help a person who may be mentally ill and harmful to self or others and refuses to seek treatment or whose judgment is so impaired they do not understand their need for treatment. How do I know if a person is mentally ill? Watch the person's behavior carefully. If the behavior only occurs when the person has been taking drugs or using alcohol, the problem could be substance abuse, not mental illness. However, if the behavior is continuous, and if the person threatens or actually harms themselves or others, or their judgment is so impaired that they do not understand their need for treatment, you may file a petition with the Probate Court where the person resides or is found. The Probate Court judge can order the person to be evaluated and, based on medical evaluations and testimony, can order the person to be treated for mental illness. If you need more information about getting help for someone who may need mental health treatment, call the Detroit-Wayne Integrated Health Network (DWIHN)at (313) 833-2500 or visit their website at www.dwihn.org Who should I call? If you need more information about getting help for someone who may need mental health treatment, call the Detroit-Wayne Integrated Health Network (DWIHN)at (313) 833-2500 or visit their website at www.dwihn.org What if the person needs an immediate evaluation? You can complete a Petition for Mental Health Treatment, pcm201 (include the mc505 and mc97 form). There is no fee. You will need to complete the form accurately, including your observations of the persons behavior, and request that a peace officer take the individual into protective custody and transport the individual to the hospital. Petitions can be filed by email anytime and will be processed during normal business hours. See this page for filing instructions. What happens next? After your Petition is accepted and processed, you will then have a hearing via Zoom in front of a Probate Judge. You will need to appear at the hearing or your petition will be dismissed. Please see this page for more Zoom hearing information. If the Judge signs the Order for Examination/Transport to authorize a psychiatric evaluation, you will receive via email all of the completed paperwork. You will then call 911 (Detroit only) or visit your local police precinct to arrange for the person to be transported to a crisis center. The Order is only valid for 10 days. If the police cannot find the person to transport them within 10 days, the order expires and a new petition would need to be filed. What will the Court need to know? During the hearing, the judge will verify that you personally observed the behavior and that it happened recently. You will be asked to describe the behavior in detail. The court will also want to know the individual's substance use habits. If the problem is determined to be substance use related, you will be referred to an agency in your area. You will also be asked whether every effort has been made to get the person to voluntarily seek help. Where will the person be taken? The police will take the person to any emergency department or crisis center. What happens at the crisis center hospital? The hospital will perform a psychiatric evaluation within 24 hours and will decide whether the person needs treatment. What if the hospital determines that the person does not require hospitalization? If the person does not require hospitalization, or is diagnosed as having a substance use problem, the hospital will release the person. Sometimes the hospital will recommend outpatient treatment. And if the person is diagnosed as requiring treatment? Then the person will be sent to a designated hospital for necessary care. Who makes the decision to hospitalize the person for psychiatric treatment? The hospital director and the Court are authorized to recommend hospitalization or release. If the hospital decides that the person requires treatment and the person does not agree to treatment, a representative will file a petition for involuntary treatment and another hearing will be scheduled. An attorney will be appointed to represent the person and the attorney is required to meet with them. Sometimes the person agrees to receive treatment at that point. If the hearing is held, the court will hear testimony from the clinical staff at the hospital and may enter an order for the person to receive treatment. How long will the person be kept in the treatment facility? The Court may order up to 60 days of treatment on the initial admission order, but the hospital makes the final decision and could release the person earlier. Could it be longer? Yes. The hospital may petition the Court for continued treatment. The Court will then hold a hearing to decide whether to grant the petition or discharge the patient. What is Assisted Outpatient Treatment? It is often not necessary for the person to remain hospitalized to receive treatment; instead, treatment can be provided on an outpatient basis. The court may order up to 180 days of assisted outpatient treatment on an initial order for involuntary treatment. Rev. 12/21 "

Click here for a list of legal aidlegal services which may be able to provide you with assistance. When would a petition for a trust be filed? There are several circumstances under which a petition to establish a trust would be filed. The most common are: I. A party may petition the Court for permission to establish a trust under certain circumstances. These include: A conservator wishes to establish a trust for a protected individual or a developmentally disabled individual (due to an out-of-court settlement, to preserve eligibility for Medicaid or other government benefits, etc.). If a Judge approves the creation of a trust and supervision is ordered in an existing Conservatorship case or Developmental Disability case, a separate trust file must be created by filing a Petition for Supervision of Trust and to Qualify Trustee, which will include the trust document. II. No conservatorship exists, but an individual wishes to establish a trust - typically for a minor  due to an out-of-court settlement, to preserve eligibility for Medicaid or other government benefits, etc. If a Judge grants the Protective Order, a separate trust file must be created by filing a Petition for Supervision of Trust and to Qualify Trustee which will include the trust document. III. A Circuit Court settlement provides for the establishment of a trust for a minor or legally incapacitated individual. No conservatorship is established. Per court rule, the trust must be approved by the Probate Court. IV. Typically, there is no preexisting active trust file when a petition of this type is filed. A party may petition the Probate Court for supervision of a trust, for the court to order specific action, or to obtain the courts approval for a particular action, for example: \u2022 Supervision requested because trust beneficiary believes trustee is not acting correctly. \u2022 Request for termination of trust, removal of trustee, release of trust document, distribution of money, to compel an accounting, objection to attorney and/or trustee fees, etc. \u2022 Trustee seeks formal approval of exercise of power under trust (i.e., make distribution, tax election, change of investments, etc.). \u2022 Trustee (or other interested person) seeks approval to alter, reform, or terminate trust Petition to Establish Trust for Protected Individual or Individual with a Developmental Disability This process is used if a conservatorship or developmental disability case exists for the person. 1. Form Used: No SCAO form; attorney drafted. Typically titled Petition for Authority to Establish Trust. 2.

No SCAO form; attorney drafted. \u2022 Petition for Supervision of Trust and to Qualify Trustee (if ordered supervised).

Note: Under EPIC, Letters of Authority are not issued to Trustees of any Trusts, inter vivos or otherwise. \u2022 A copy of the order from the petition to establish trust. 4. If no assets will remain in the Conservatorship, the Conservator must file a Final Account. A receipt for the funds transferred to the Trust will be required from the Trustee to close the Conservatorship. Petition for Protective Order to establish Trust This process is used if no conservatorship or developmental disability case exists. In these situations, a protective order must be filed to obtain authorization to establish the trust. 1. Form Used: PC 639, Petition for Appointment of Conservator and/or Protective Order; attorney drafted form can also be accepted, either filed with the PC 639 or on its own. 2. It is filed as PO (Protective Order) case type. 3. If the petition is granted, the Trustee must open a new TV case by filing the following documents: \u2022 Petition to Qualify Trustee (if no supervision). No SCAO form; attorney drafted. \u2022 Petition for Supervision of Trust and to Qualify Trustee (if ordered supervised). No SCAO form; attorney drafted and a copy of the Trust. \u2022 Acceptance of Appointment (AOA). Note: Under EPIC, Letters of Authority are not issued to Trustees of any Trusts, inter vivos or otherwise. \u2022 A copy of the order from the petition to establish trust. Petition for Approval of Trust (Circuit Court Settlement) What is it? MCR 2.420 is a court rule that contains the procedures for settlements for minors and legally incapacitated individuals. It states: (5) If a settlement or judgment provides for the creation of a trust for the minor or legally incapacitated individual, the circuit court shall determine the amount to be paid to the trust, but the trust shall not be funded without prior approval of the trust by the probate court pursuant to notice to all interested persons and a hearing.

If the petition is granted, and supervision is ordered: \u2022 If bond required as part of the order, it must be filed with the Court. Note: A bond is not required unless ordered by the Judge. Approval of the trust will be delayed until any required bond is submitted and approved by the Court. \u2022 The Trustee is to file an inventory and annual accounts. Trust - Petition For Supervision/Litigation 1. Form Used: No set form; attorney drafted. Title would typically reflect relief requested: i.e., Petition for Removal of Trustee, Petition to Terminate Trust, Petition to Reform Trust, Petition to Compel Accounting, etc. and a copy of the Trust, if applicable. 2. Case Type: TV if an inter vivos (i.e., revocable living) trust; TT if a testamentary trust (i.e., trust under will). \u2022 If granted, and supervision is not ordered, the case will be closed. Examples of cases to be closed after hearing: - Trust terminated - Trust amended/altered - Exercise of trust power granted/denied (i.e., make distribution, tax election, change of investments, etc.) - Trustee resigns and replaced by successor trustee \u2022 If granted, and supervision is ordered, the case will remain open. Examples of supervision of trust cases to be kept open after hearing: - Trustee directed to provide account(s) to beneficiaries. - Trustee removed and directed to file final account(s). - Successor trustee appointed and directed to provide accounts. \u2022 If continuing administration is ordered, the trustee is to file inventory and annual accounts.

FAQs An estate must be opened if a person dies with property in their name alone (not joint), or owns an insurance policy or retirement benefits and has not named anyone as a beneficiary or has made the money payable to the estate. A personal representative is appointed by the court to handle the administration of the decedents estate. A petitioner would file a decedent's estate in the county in which the decedent was domiciled (usually, this is where the decedent lived) at the time of death. If the decedent was domiciled outside of Michigan but had property in Michigan, the petitioner may file an estate in the county where decedents property was located at the time of death. Estate UNDER the Maximum Estate Value to use a Small Estate Petition: Estate OVER the Maximum Estate Value to use a Small Estate Petition: To determine if the decedent had a Will. If they did, copies must be given to the beneficiaries. A hearing must be conducted so the Judge can determine whether the will is valid. Gather the estates assets and determine what they are worth. This includes checking the decedents safety deposit box; determining what, if any, insurance, social security, pension, veterans or other benefits are payable to the estate or its beneficiaries; and obtaining appraisals, if necessary. Within 91 days of being appointed, the personal representative in supervised administration is required to file an Inventory with the court listing all the decedents assets. For unsupervised administration, the inventory must be presented to or be filed with the court within 91 days. In all estates, the personal representative must provide all interested persons with an Inventory within 91 days. Give notice to the decedents creditors. This must be published in a legal newspaper; if you know of particular creditors of the decedent, they must be given actual notice. You must determine what creditors claims, if any, should be paid. Click here for publication information. The personal representative must keep careful records of all income of the estate and all disbursements of the estates funds. The personal representative must keep the estates assets separate and never borrow from them. In supervised administration, file an annual Account each year within 56 days of the anniversary date of the personal representatives appointment and a Complete Estate Settlement when the estate is ready to be closed. The Account must list receipts (monies in) and disbursements (monies out). Save your receipts; one must be presented to the court for each disbursement. In unsupervised administration the Accounts do not have to be filed with the Court, but they must still be served on interested persons. If the estate is not settled within a year of the first personal representatives appointment, file a Notice of Continued Administration with the court stating why the estate must remain open. A copy of this notice must be given to all interested persons. Ensure that all taxes on the estate are paid. You must also see that the decedents final federal, state and city income taxes are paid and the returns filed. If the personal representative does not timely perform their duties, any interested person or the court itself may start proceedings to remove the personal representative or to force them to take action. The personal representative may be held liable for losses caused by his or her mistakes or for failing to act quickly and sensibly. No. You can decline to serve as personal representative. If you decline, the court will appoint someone else. Once you are appointed, you cannot resign without the courts permission. Yes. The amount must be reasonable and is subject to review by the court. The fees cannot be taken until the administration of the estate is completed. Yes. You can use attorneys, accountants, investment advisors or other professionals to help assist in estate administration.

    "scripted_value": "FAQs When an individual with a developmental disability needs protection for any reason, including protection from neglect, exploitation, or abuse, the person may be in need of a guardian. An individual with a developmental disability may need a guardian of the person to make daily living decisions. An individual with a developmental disability may need a guardian of the estate to manage his or her property or finances. The law states that a guardian may be appointed if a court determines that a person is an individual with a developmental disability. The law defines a developmental disability as: A severe, chronic condition attributable to mental and/or physical impairment likely to continue indefinitely that results in substantial functional limitations in at least three of the following areas: self-care, language, learning, mobility, self-direction, capacity for independent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Generally, it can be said that the guardian of the person makes decisions about the person, such as medical or housing decisions, and the guardian of the estate makes decisions about the property or the finances of an individual with a developmental disability. A guardian of the person and a guardian of the estate can be the same person or institution, or they may be different. For example, a guardian of the person could be a person and a guardian of the estate could be a trust company or bank. Unless an emergency exists and the appointment of a temporary guardian is requested, evaluations of the individual with a developmental disability must be conducted. Whoever files the petition for the appointment of a guardian for an individual with a developmental disability, they must attach evaluations of the proposed wards mental, physical, social, educational condition, adaptive behavior, and social skills. These evaluations can be obtained by contacting your own private sources or by contacting the Detroit-Wayne Integrated Health Network (DWIHN). If a facility or program director is the petitioner, then a recommendation from the Informed Consent Board is required. Click here for more information on how to open a case. A guardian of the person and estate may be appointed by a Probate Judge after a petition is filed in the Probate Court. The petition may be filed by anyone interested in the well-being of an individual with a developmental disability. When the petition is filed, professionally licensed persons must evaluate the individual with a developmental disability and report their findings to the court. Upon receipt of the evaluations, a hearing will be scheduled and held within 30 days. The person who files the petition has the responsibility to properly notify the persons who have a right to know about the hearing. On the date of the hearing, the petitioner and anyone else who wants to take part in the hearing goes before the Judge and explains the need for a guardian of the person or guardian of the estate. The court will appoint an attorney to represent the individual with a developmental disability at the hearing. Sometimes, the court will also appoint a guardian ad litem to assist the attorney. In addition, detailed testimony must be taken from one report evaluator. The Judge will decide whether to appoint a guardian of the person and/or a guardian of the estate. The person who is appointed guardian of the person is required to file an Acceptance of Appointment. The person who is appointed guardian of the estate may also be required to file a Bond to protect the assets of the individual with a developmental disability. After filing the Acceptance of Appointment (and Bond, if required), Letters of Guardianship will be issued to the guardian of the person or the guardian of the estate. The Letters of Guardianship give the guardian of the person or guardian of the estate the right to perform certain duties, unless the court restricts the authority. The Account must list receipts (monies in) and disbursements (monies out). Save your receipts; one must be presented to the court for each disbursement. Click here for more detailed information about how to terminate the guardianship. Anyone, including the individual with a developmental disability, may file a petition to modify or terminate the guardianship or to have a different guardian appointed. When the individual no longer has a developmental disability or dies, the guardian must notify the court immediately so that the guardianship can be ended and the court's case closed. Before the guardian of the estate can be discharged, a final account will have to be filed and approved by the court and the court will have to be satisfied that the individual or his or her estate has received whatever assets remain. If you have questions that this page did not answer, please seek advice from an attorney. Rev. 4/22"

Click here for a list of legal aidlegal services which may be able to provide you with assistance. What is a probate bond? A probate bond is an insurance policy that protects assets and income in an estate, trust, or conservatorship from certain actions of the fiduciary (either the personal presentative, trustee, or conservator, respectively). This bond is obtained through a surety company, and often referred to as a fiduciary bond. Probate bonds, once obtained, can only be discharged and canceled through an order from the Probate Court. When would a bond be obtained? Every fiduciary (whether guardian, conservator, personal representative, etc.) in Probate Court must file an Acceptance of Appointment (AOA), PC571, to qualify with the Court before they can start acting in that role. The Court may also order that a fiduciary obtain and file a bond in addition to the AOA. When a person is directed to file an AOA and a bond, both must be submitted for the individual to qualify as the fiduciary and receive the Letter of Authority. Additionally, sometimes a bond can be ordered after an individual qualifies as a fiduciary. In these situations, if additional liquid assets (i.e., cash or other assets that can be easily converted into cash) are identified in an estate, trust, or protective proceeding, the court may order the fiduciary file a bond relating to these additional assets. Further, sometimes a bond that was previously obtained and filed with the court can be modified. When the assets or income in the estate, trust, or conservatorship change, the Court may review the amount of the bond and increase or decrease the amount to be protected through the bond accordingly. When a different bond amount is ordered, a new bond order is issued and a new bond or revised bond must be obtained and filed with the Court. SCAO form PC570, Bond of Fiduciary, (pc570.p65 (michigan.gov)), must be attached to all bonds submitted to the Court. MCR 5.113(A).

    "scripted_value": "Guardianship.............................................. $175.00 Conservatorship..........................................$175.00 When an adult becomes unable to make responsible decisions, then that adult may be in need of a guardian, conservator, or other alternative. The law states that a guardian may be appointed if a court determines that a person is an incapacitated individual. The law defines an incapacitated individual as: \u2026one who is impaired by reason of mental illness, mental deficiency, physical illness or disability, chronic use of drugs, chronic intoxication, or other cause, not including minority, to the extent of lacking sufficient understanding or capacity to make or communicate informed decisions. A conservator may also be appointed if the person is unable to manage his or her property or finances effectively. A petitioner would file a guardianship petition in either the county where the adult resides (i.e., where they live) or is present. A petitioner would file a conservatorship petition in the county where the adult resides (i.e., where they live). If the adult resides outside of Michigan , but has property in Michigan , the petitioner may file a conservatorship in the county where the adults property is located. Generally it can be said that the guardian makes decisions about the person, such as medical or housing decisions, and the conservator makes decisions about the property or the finances of the person. A guardian and a conservator can be the same person or institution or they may be different. For example, a guardian could be a person and a conservator could be a trust company or bank. >A guardian or conservator may be appointed by a Probate Judge after a petition is filed in the Probate Court. The petition may be filed by anyone interested in the well being of the adult. When the petition is filed, a hearing will be scheduled. In addition, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to investigate the situation and make a recommendation to the court prior to the hearing. On the date of the hearing, the petitioner and anyone else who wants to take part in the hearing goes before the Judge (all hearings are being done remotely via ZOOM due to the health emergency) and explains the need for a guardian or conservator. The Judge will decide whether to appoint a guardian and/or a conservator. The person who is appointed guardian is required to file an Acceptance of Appointment. The person who is appointed conservator must also file an Acceptance of Appointment and may also be required to file a Bond to protect the adults assets. After filing the Acceptance of Appointment (and Bond, if required), Letters of Authority will be issued to the guardian or conservator. The Letters of Authority give the guardian or conservator the right to perform certain duties, unless the court restricts their authority. If an emergency exists, the Judge may appoint a temporary guardian at a hearing. A letter from a doctor or social worker may be required to explain the nature of the emergency. Please note that a second hearing is required. The guardian generally has the same authority and responsibility for the adult as a parent has for a minor child. The guardian is required to file every year an Annual Report of Guardian on Condition of Incapacitated Individual. The report must be filed within 56 days of the anniversary date of the appointment. They must also give a copy of the report to the adult and the persons listed on the guardianship petition. The information contained in the report allows the court to assess how the guardianship is working and whether it is still necessary. The court will also review a guardianship within a year of the guardian being appointed and at least once every three years afterwards. You must visit the ward within 3 months of becoming guardian and at least once every 3 months after your last visit. The guardian may make routine medical decisions but may not consent to extraordinary medical procedures without a court order. A major goal of the guardian is always to try to restore the ward to independence. Within 56 days of being appointed, the conservator must file an Inventory. The Inventory is a listing of all assets of the adult. Assets may consist of real estate, stocks, bonds, certificates of deposit, savings and checking accounts, and personal belongings and everything in which the adult has an interest. It is the duty of the conservator to care for and preserve all of the assets of the adult and to represent the adult in any legal proceeding. The conservator must keep careful records of all income of the adult and all disbursements of the adults funds. The conservator must keep the adults assets separate from his or her own assets and never borrow from the adults assets. It is the duty of the conservator to file an Annual Account each year within 56 days after the anniversary date of the conservators appointment. They must also give a copy of the account to the adult and the persons listed on the conservatorship petition. The account must list receipts (monies in) and disbursements (monies out). Save your receipts; one must be presented to the court for each disbursement . Anyone, including the adult, may file a petition to terminate the guardianship or conservatorship or to have a different guardian or conservator appointed. With the courts permission, the guardian may resign at any time. When the adult is no longer an incapacitated individual or dies, the court should be notified immediately so that the guardianship or conservatorship can be ended and the courts case closed. Before the conservator can be discharged, a Final Account will have to be filed and approved by the court and the court will have to be satisfied that the adult or his or her estate has received whatever assets remain. If you have any questions about what services or procedures may be available that might make guardianship or conservatorship unnecessary, you may call the Commission on Aging, Department of Mental Health, or Department of Health and Human Services. If you have questions that this pamphlet did not answer, please seek legal advice from an attorney. By law, court employees are not permitted to give legal advice. Due to the health emergency, the court is closed to the public. All items are filed via email (probateservice@wcpc.us), FAX (313-967-4030) or mail.

Guardianships and conservatorships are fiduciary relationships created by the court. The court authorizes a person to act as guardian or conservator of another person according to the terms of the court order. It depends upon the authority granted by the Power of Attorney.

Note : Wayne County Probate Court will not appoint a special personal representative on an informal application. For additional information, see Decedent Estate (found under Information  How to Start a Wayne County Probate Court Case) If there are no probate assets (i.e., nothing owned by the decedent in their name only), or it is thought that (1) the estate assets will be less than the cost of the funeral and other funeral related expenses or (2) the estate assets exceed funeral costs but there is also an urgent need to obtain medical records, a special personal representative could be appointed for the sole purpose of obtaining the deceased persons medical records. The letters of authority issued by the Court would limit the special personal representatives powers to securing medical records only. If there were no probate assets, the special personal representative could close the estate by filing an Inventory (PC 577) and preparing either: - A first and final Account of Fiduciary (PC 583or PC 584) to be filed and allowed with Waivers and Consents (PC 561) or at a hearing. Submitting a Sworn Statement to Close Unsupervised Administration (PC 591) and serving it on all interested persons. Notice to creditors would not be required.
